WxT Library
===========

This module leverages the native Drupal library system to load the
[WxT jQuery Framework's][wet_boew] relevant assets.

## Installation

There are two installation methods `standalone` + `distro`  to leverage the
[WxT Bootstrap][wxt_bootstrap] theme in Drupal 8. The `standalone` install is
provided as an additional method for those who do not wish to have the full
weight of a distribution and its required dependencies.
### StandAlone Requirements

`Standalone` Install: WxT Library downloads the
[WxT jQuery Framework's][wet_boew] packaged bootstrap libraries that
[WxT Bootstrap][wxt_bootstrap] expects.

### Distribution Requirements

`Distro` Install: All dependencies are included as part of the
[Drupal WxT][drupal_wxt] distribution and come completely configured alongside
with additional integrations.
